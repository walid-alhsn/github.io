  <section id="now">
    <h2>What I am working on now</h2>
    <p>
      Right now I am learning SQL for working with databases and practising Java programming as well as Python programming
      to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next year I aim to build small web applications that connect a web front end
      to a real database, so I can practise full-stack development and data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in roles and projects related to web development, data engineering and artificial intelligence,
      where I can design efficient intelligent systems and work with real-world datasets.

    <h2>Production diary</h2>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Date:</strong> 3 February 2026</p>
    <p>This day, we got introduced to github, created a github account and repository, learnt how to use and navigate the platform and hosted our first website.</p>

    <p>
      I am most happy that I got to host the site publicly so anyone could access it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found it difficult to edit my code in github at first, but i got the hang of it
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time I want to improve my website layout, structure and information.
    </p>

    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Date:</strong> 10 February 2026</p>
    <p>
      This day I worked on my GitHub Pages portfolio website. I focused on
      creating or improving the main sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
    </p>
    <p>
      I am most happy that I was able to structure my portfolio website well and entered most information
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't have any difficulties
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time I want to refine my website to look cleaner.
    </p>

    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Date:</strong> 13 February 2026</p>
    <p>
      This day I refined my page by centralising the section headers, and dividing sections using hr lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am most happy that I was able to structure my portfolio website well and entered most information
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't have any difficulties
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time I want to add styling to my website to make it colourful and for the text to have better font styles.
